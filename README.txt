ProtoLib is a work in progress library automation program created using C#, WPF, Entity Framework, MS SQL Server 2008 Express R2 and some design patterns such as MVVM, layered architecture and multi-level validation with IDataErrorInfo etc. etc.

It was my very first attempt at a practical MVVM solution & also a layered architecture, so faces common problems like MVVM-dialogs with custom solutions that work, but I have since found better methods.
It also has a very cool transition system between different screens :P

Only the stuff shown in the screenshots are completed to a decent degree. The rest is in progress.


SCREENSHOTS: (Don't mind the gibberish/wrong values)

This project is currently ON HOLD till I finish ProcrastinHater... and maybe till the future of WPF becomes clearer? So I'll just dump this here on GitHub for safe keeping.
